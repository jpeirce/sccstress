PATCHES
=======

The extensions I made to the original stress program are probably very poorly coded, but the work for what I need it to work for. If you make some changes I would very much like to see them. Please send patches via email or make a git commit. 

The original maintainer of the stress program was Amos Waterland, the original homepage was http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/
